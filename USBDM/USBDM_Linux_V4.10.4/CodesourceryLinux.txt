Codesourcery with USBDM
=================================
Manually copy the various gdb servers (e.g.usbdm-arm-gdbServer) to the bin directory
of the appropriate Codesource installation.

There is a tutorial in the documentation that explains the setup for windows.  A very similar
process may be followed for linux.
